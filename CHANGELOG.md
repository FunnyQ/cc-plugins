# Changelog

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-21

### ✨ New Features

- **Live usage-limits panel**: New dashboard panel that surfaces your real-time quota windows so you can see how close you are to hitting limits at a glance.
- **Claude rate limits from the statusline**: Token Atlas now reads your Claude Code rate limits via a lightweight statusline collector and shows your 5-hour and weekly usage windows live.
- **Codex live usage limits**: The same panel now pulls live rate limits for Codex too, displaying Claude and Codex windows side by side with provider-specific states and empty states.
- **One-step statusline setup**: A new setup flow can auto-wire the statusline collector into your Claude Code settings (with backup and your approval), and re-discovers the installed plugin path after cache updates — no manual config editing.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Redesigned usage-limits panel**: Circular gauges replace horizontal bars, and Claude and Codex now sit in separate, clearly badged sub-panels for easier reading.
- **Smarter limit visuals**: Meters use severity-encoded fills (amber to magenta), a time-elapsed marker that reveals when you're burning faster than the window pace, and a projected-at-reset indicator with safe/warn/over levels.
- **Better dashboard pacing**: The Monthly budget panel now sits directly above the Usage shifts panel, keeping spend-pacing and anomaly questions next to each other.
- **Accessibility**: Usage meters now expose ARIA progressbar attributes for screen readers.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-05-18

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Dashboard HTML maintainability**: Split the generated dashboard shell into focused partial files and added a lightweight loader so the shipped interface stays easier to maintain without changing runtime behavior.

### 📖 Documentation

- **README feature overview**: Simplified the feature list into clearer grouped sections and removed visual direction copy so marketplace readers can scan the plugin capabilities faster.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-05-18

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Dashboard preview in README**: Added the Token Atlas dashboard screenshot so marketplace visitors can see the current Sunrise Atlas experience before installing.
- **Install guidance polish**: Clarified the automatic precheck behavior and fixed marketplace/CLI install syntax so setup instructions match the current plugin workflow.
- **Dashboard asset organization**: Split the shipped dashboard runtime and styles into focused modules, making future updates easier to maintain without changing the user-facing dashboard behavior.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-05-17

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Auto-precheck before launch**: `SKILL.md` now chains the install precheck in front of `serve-dashboard.ts`, so the dashboard only starts once the environment is verified. Failed checks surface verbatim with their hints — no silent auto-fixes.
- **Required vs optional install checks**: `install.ts` now distinguishes required failures (`✗`, exit 1) from optional ones (`○`, exit 0 with a notice). Missing `history.jsonl` — common for fresh Claude Code installs without chat history — no longer blocks the dashboard; the project ranking section just stays empty.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Plugin manifest version drift**: `token-atlas/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` was stuck at `1.0.0` while the marketplace tracked `2.0.x`. Both files now agree on the released version.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-17

### 📖 Documentation

- **README refresh for Sunrise Atlas**: Updated feature list to reflect the v2.0.0 dashboard — daily burn hero, monthly budget tracker, project drilldown modal, session ledger, anomaly panel, token composition & cache efficiency, data health diagnostics, light/dark themes, pointer-tracking bloom, animated hero wave, current-view export, and persisted preferences. Added a one-line note that the visual direction is "Sunrise Atlas — Big Sur dawn palette over a calm working surface".
- **CLAUDE.md updates for contributors**: Documented the theme system (`[data-theme]` tokens + View Transitions cross-fade), the Sunrise Bloom delight (cursor-tracking radial glow on panels/cards — with a reminder to register new panel-shaped classes in both the CSS selector list and the JS `SELECTOR` constant), and the hero wave mask animation. Added CHANGELOG.md to the project tree and switched the PRODUCT.md description from "Nordic-inflected" to "Sunrise Atlas".

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-17

### ✨ New Features

- **Sunrise Atlas redesign**: Complete visual overhaul of the Token Atlas dashboard with a warm dawn-to-dusk palette inspired by Big Sur. Cost is now the hero metric, set against a layered animated wave band.
- **Light & dark themes**: Theme toggle that respects `prefers-color-scheme` on first load, persists your choice, and cross-fades smoothly between Dawn (light) and Dusk (dark) modes.
- **Daily burn metric**: Primary cost card now shows your average daily spend with a sparkline trend and comparison delta against the previous period.
- **Monthly budget tracker**: Configure a monthly budget and see month-to-date spend, remaining budget, and projected burn rate alongside a sunrise-spectrum progress meter.
- **Project drilldown**: Selectable project cards open a viewport-safe modal with a provider-aware model breakdown for each project.
- **Session ledger**: Unified, sortable, filterable table of recent Claude sessions and Codex threads in one place.
- **Usage anomaly panel**: Detects elevated usage days from your active baseline and surfaces which models drove the spike.
- **Token composition & cache efficiency**: New dashboard sections that break down where your tokens go and how much your prompt cache is saving you.
- **Export current view**: One-click JSON or CSV exports scoped to the active provider and date range, grouped under a single export dropdown.
- **Data health diagnostics**: Compact footer panel showing the status of each local data source (Claude, Codex, pricing) — non-fatal failures no longer block the dashboard.
- **Persisted preferences**: Your filter, range, and view choices now stick across reloads.
- **Variance comparison**: Selected ranges show deltas against the prior equivalent period, with pricing-confidence metadata so you know how solid an estimate is.
- **Loading overlay**: Animated full-screen sunrise overlay during initial data fetch, with staggered "Reading local traces" title and layered breathing waves.
- **Pointer-tracking glow**: Subtle cursor-following radial glow on interactive surfaces — fully respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Typography overhaul**: Self-hosted Fraunces variable font for editorial display headings, SF Pro Rounded for hero metric values, system stack for body — full offline support.
- **Refined visual tokens**: Normalized heading sizes, panel spacing, radii, and motion tokens across the dashboard.
- **Big Sur sunrise wallpaper**: New translucent dawn and dusk background veils replace the previous Nordic-themed asset.
- **Chart palette refresh**: Claude pulls warm dawn hues (coral/amber/gold), Codex pulls cool dusk hues (violet/magenta/indigo/sky).
- **Hero wave motion**: Three-layer animated waves with organic, out-of-phase drift and skew — restrained 5–8px amplitudes.
- **Cost-first hierarchy**: Dashboard reordered so cost reads first — hero → KPI strip → budget → trend → per-model table → usage shifts → activity → ledger → data health.
- **Qwen pricing defaults**: Added qwen pricing defaults and external pricing alias resolution.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Dark mode badges**: Fixed status badges and modals showing cold-blue residue in dark mode — they now read as warm-tinted patches.

### 📖 Documentation

- **Brand pivot to Sunrise Atlas**: Rewrote PRODUCT.md brand personality from Nordic mythology to "warm, composed, watching the sun come up over your data"; added SHAPE.md design brief covering layout, states, and interaction model.
